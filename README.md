# Prime-Factoriser
This Program gives you the Prime Factors of any integer you enter
It works in such a way that it accepts any integer from the user and divides by the number which the user has entered by a prime number and displays the numbers prime factors and also the number of times it divides the number which the user has entered.

For example: 
The user enteres: 36
So the result will be: 
2
2
3
3

This way, the user may also figure out whether the number he/she has entered is a perfect square number or a perfect cube of any integer or not
I hope you like this program and learned something new.
Have a great day!!
